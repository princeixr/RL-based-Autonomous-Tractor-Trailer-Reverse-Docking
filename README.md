# RL-Based Autonomous Tractor–Trailer Reverse Docking

A simulation-based course project for safely reversing a tractor–trailer into a selected logistics-center loading dock. The project combines trajectory-aware reinforcement learning, a conventional control baseline, reference-path generation, collision and jackknife constraints, and a final 3D simulation.

## Project goal

The core research question is whether a PPO controller using path-relative preview information can reliably reverse a tractor–trailer into a loading dock and how it compares with a model-based controller under varied starting poses, vehicle parameters, and observation noise.

The six-week core scope is intentionally focused on:

- A verified low-speed tractor–trailer model
- Fixed or simply generated docking references
- A classical trajectory-tracking baseline
- A trajectory-aware PPO controller
- Collision and jackknife detection
- Quantitative held-out evaluation
- One reproducible 3D reverse-docking demonstration

LiDAR mapping, visual dock-number recognition, advanced global planning, and dynamic obstacles are stretch goals rather than critical-path requirements.

## Related industry-scale work

This problem is already receiving significant industrial investment and deployment:

- [Outrider](https://www.outrider.ai/press-releases/outrider-builds-first-in-industry-safety-system-for-driverless-yard-operations/) develops autonomous yard trucks that move, hitch, and back trailers in mixed-traffic logistics yards. Its system also integrates trailer brake-line connection and yard-management software. [Its 2024 Series D announcement](https://www.outrider.ai/press-releases/outrider-closes-62-million-series-d-financing-to-drive-growth-of-yard-automation/) reported a $62 million round and more than $250 million in total equity funding.

Reported validation includes mixed-traffic driving, narrow-lane maneuvering, reverse parking, and centimeter-level motion planning.

- [Einride](https://www.einride.tech/press/einride-operates-first-ever-fully-autonomous-heavy-duty-truck-on-a-public-road-in-belgium-at-the-port-of-antwerp-bruges) and [Volvo Autonomous Solutions](https://www.volvoautonomoussolutions.com/en-en/autona-freight.html) are developing broader autonomous freight and terminal ecosystems. Their focus extends beyond dock backing but demonstrates the commercial direction of autonomous logistics.

These systems reinforce the project’s modular design: perception and localization supply a structured world state, planning produces a feasible maneuver, control executes it, and an independent safety layer monitors the vehicle.
